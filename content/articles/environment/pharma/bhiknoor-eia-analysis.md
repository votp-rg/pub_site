# Scientific and Procedural Critique of the Draft EIA Report

# Proposed Expansion of Bulk Drugs & Pharmaceutical Intermediates Project

# M/s Fusion Health Care Pvt. Ltd.**

## 1. Executive Statement

This critique is submitted on behalf of the affected local communities, which will bear the environmental, health, and safety risks associated with the proposed expansion. The review is grounded in strict scientific principles, regulatory requirements under the EIA Notification, 2006, and established chemical engineering practice.

Our central submission is that the Draft EIA is **not a genuine environmental impact assessment**, but a document structured to **minimise, generalise, and in critical places conceal risk**, primarily through omission, aggregation, and non-quantification. The report therefore fails the basic purpose of EIA: **informed decision-making based on precaution and public health protection**.

## 2. Fundamental Procedural Defect: Legacy of B2 Clearance and Evasion of Safeguards

The project was originally granted Environmental Clearance under **Category B2** during the COVID-19 period, when public consultation and full EIA were waived as an emergency relaxation.

The present proposal:

- Significantly increases production capacity,
- Increases hazardous chemical throughput,
- Introduces expanded solvent handling and waste streams.

Yet the Draft EIA **does not critically re-examine the legitimacy or consequences of the original B2 clearance**, nor does it acknowledge that:

- The affected population was **systematically excluded** from the initial decision,
- The current proposal represents a **qualitative escalation of risk**, not a routine expansion.

This constitutes **procedural evasion**, where a project is socially and environmentally locked in through an initial exemption and later normalised via expansion.

## 3. Misleading Implication of Technical Competence

The Draft EIA implicitly assumes operational competence in bulk drug manufacturing but **fails to disclose the proponent’s lack of demonstrated experience in synthetic bulk drug production**.

Facts omitted or obscured:

- The proponent operates a **formulation unit at Haridwar**, which involves blending and packaging.
- Bulk drug synthesis involves **hazardous reactions, solvent recovery, toxic gas generation, and accident-prone batch operations**, which are categorically different.

This omission is not trivial. **Operational experience directly determines accident probability, emission control reliability, and emergency response capability**.  
Silence on this issue constitutes **deception by omission**.

## 4. Air Emissions: Deliberate Aggregation to Obscure Toxicity

### 4.1 Use of “VOC emissions” as a Risk-Blurring Device

The EIA consistently aggregates chemically distinct substances under the generic label “VOCs”, even though:

- Methanol, IPA, toluene, acetone, dichloromethane (DCM), etc., have **radically different toxicological profiles**,
- Some are neurotoxic, some carcinogenic, some acutely irritating.

This aggregation **prevents meaningful health risk assessment** and is scientifically indefensible.

### 4.2 Fugitive Solvent Loss: Admitted Quantity, Suppressed Consequences

The Draft EIA itself admits:

- **Given fugitive solvent losses of approximately 652 kg/day**.

However, the report:

- Does not calculate workplace air concentrations,
- Does not estimate off-site ambient concentrations,
- Does not assess chronic exposure for workers or nearby residents.

This is a critical failure. **Once a mass emission is admitted, dispersion and exposure assessment are mandatory**. The omission is not accidental; it avoids revealing the magnitude of health risk.

## 5. Control Devices Misrepresented as Elimination Measures

Throughout the report, a recurring logical fallacy is employed:

“Scrubber/condenser provided → therefore no emission.”

This is **fundamentally unscientific**.

Established chemical-engineering facts:

- No scrubber or condenser operates at 100% efficiency,
- Start-up, shutdown, batch peaks, and upset conditions guarantee residual emissions,
- Fugitive emissions are, by definition, uncontrolled.

By presenting control equipment as equivalent to elimination, the EIA **misrepresents mitigation as the absence of impact**, which is a serious technical misrepresentation.

## 6. Risk Assessment in Name Only: Absence of Quantitative Analysis

The consolidated chemical inventory derived from Tables 2.1–2.5 demonstrates that the proposed facility will routinely handle pyrophoric reagents, carcinogenic and reproductive toxic solvents, highly flammable liquids, and generate corrosive toxic gases. These hazards are intrinsic to the disclosed processes and are not hypothetical. Although the EIA claims that risk assessment has been conducted, it provides **none of the elements required for a Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA)**:

Missing entirely:

- Toxic gas release scenarios and impact distances,
- Explosion over-pressure contours,
- Thermal radiation zones from fires,
- Mapping of nearby habitations against hazard contours.

This is particularly grave because:

- Nearest habitations are acknowledged to be approximately **1.14 km away**,
- Bulk drug units are internationally recognised as accident-prone.

What is presented is **not a risk assessment, but a checklist of safety equipment**.

## 7. Proximity to Population: Recognition Without Consequence

The EIA acknowledges the proximity of villages, yet:

- Does not analyse worst-case scenarios,
- Does not assess night-time exposure,
- Does not evaluate vulnerable groups (children, elderly, pregnant women).

This reflects a recurring pattern: **facts are acknowledged but analytically neutralised**.
## 8. Water, ZLD, and Failure Scenarios Ignored

The report claims Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) compliance, yet:

- Does not analyse failure modes of MEE, RO, or solvent stripping,
- Does not assess cumulative groundwater stress,
- Does not consider secondary air emissions from effluent treatment and evaporation.

ZLD is presented as a **slogan, not an engineered system with failure probabilities**.

## 9. Overall Pattern of Deception

The Draft EIA does not rely on explicit falsehoods. Instead, it systematically employs:

- **Aggregation instead of specification**,
- **Control devices instead of quantified residuals**,
- **Assertions instead of calculations**,
- **Lists instead of models**,
- **Acknowledgement of facts without consequence analysis**.

This constitutes **deception by framing and omission**, which is more insidious than direct misstatement.

## 10. Conclusion: Why This EIA Is Unfit for Appraisal

From the perspective of affected communities and sound science:

- The EIA fails to characterise real risks,
- It denies decision-makers the information needed for precaution,
- It undermines public health protection,
- It violates the spirit of the EIA Notification, 2006.

**This Draft EIA should therefore be:**

1.  **Rejected in its present form**, and
2.  Returned with directions for:
    - Full pollutant-specific emission quantification,
    - Proper QRA with mapped impact distances,
    - Transparent assessment of fugitive emissions,
    - Explicit evaluation of odour and sulphur gas risks,
    - Independent verification of operational competence.

Until these are done, **any appraisal would be scientifically unsound and procedurally unsafe**.
