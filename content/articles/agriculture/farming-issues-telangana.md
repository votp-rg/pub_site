# Farming in Telangana: Major Issues in 2026

As of early 2026, agriculture in Telangana remains the backbone of the state's economy. However, the sector is currently navigating a mix of technical, environmental, and structural hurdles. Here is a simple breakdown of the most pressing farming issues this year.

## 1. The Fertilizer Distribution Crisis

The most immediate problem facing farmers in the current **Rabi (winter) season** is the shortage of urea and technical glitches in its distribution.

* **The "Fertilizer App" Glitches:** The state government introduced a mobile app to streamline urea distribution and prevent hoarding. Unfortunately, technical failures at Primary Agricultural Cooperative Societies (PACS) have led to long queues and delayed delivery during critical crop growth periods.
* **Overuse of Urea:** Experts from PJTSAU (Telangana Agricultural University) have warned that farmers are using **50-100% more urea** than recommended. This is damaging soil health and making crops more vulnerable to pests like the stem borer.

## 2. Irrigation and Water Rights

Water remains a sensitive political and practical issue. The state is currently focused on finishing long-pending projects while defending its share of river water.

* **Pending Projects:** The government is under pressure to complete the **Krishna Basin** projects within the next few years. There is significant debate over the relocation of project intake points (like the Palamuru-Rangareddy project), which critics argue has increased costs and reduced water reliability.
* **Inter-State Disputes:** Telangana is currently opposing the Polavaram-Nallamala link project proposed by Andhra Pradesh, arguing it violates inter-state water regulations and threatens Telangana’s Godavari water rights.

## 3. Climate Volatility and Pest Pressure

The 2025-2026 agricultural cycle has seen a "structural shift" in how pests behave due to changing weather patterns.

* **Extreme Weather:** Erratic humidity and heat stress have made traditional pest control less effective. New threats like the **Fall Armyworm** in Maize and **Tikka Leafspot** in groundnut are requiring more expensive and specialized chemical treatments.
* **Cold Injury:** In early January 2026, low night temperatures have caused "cold injury" to rice nurseries, forcing farmers to change their water management practices (like draining beds in the morning and refilling with fresh water) to save their saplings.

## 4. Shift to Commercial Crops

To escape the cycle of low profits in paddy and cotton, many farmers are shifting toward **Oil Palm** cultivation.

* **Government Push:** With subsidies of up to 90% for small farmers, districts like Rajanna Sircilla are seeing a massive shift to oil palm.
* **The Risk:** While oil palm offers a steady income for up to 35 years, it requires high initial investment and consistent water, which can be a gamble for farmers without reliable irrigation.

## 5. Financial Delays in Schemes

While schemes like **Rythu Bharosa** (providing ₹12,000 per acre per year) are active, administrative delays often slow down the release of funds.

* **Fund Utilization:** The Central government has recently warned states to spend earmarked farm funds before March to avoid bottlenecks.
* **Verification Hurdles:** New digital verification processes through the *Dharani* portal have occasionally delayed payments to farmers who have unresolved land title issues.

### Summary Table: Key Concerns in 2026

| Issue | Main Cause | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Urea Shortage** | Technical app glitches & high demand | Stunted crop growth & farmer protests |
| **Soil Health** | Excessive chemical use | Decreased land fertility & higher pest attacks |
| **Water Disputes** | Inter-state river disagreements | Uncertainty for drought-prone regions |
| **Pests** | Climate change/Humidity | Increased cost of cultivation |
