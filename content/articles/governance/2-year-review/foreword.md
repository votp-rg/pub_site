**This review of the Civil Society Review on the functioning of the State Government is a reminder, for government to course correct.**

As of December 7, 2025, the Congress government in Telangana has completed two years. After nine and a half years of authoritarian rule by the BRS party since 2014, the people delivered their verdict and brought the Congress party to power in the state. Civil society in Telangana believed that the destructive ten-year rule of BRS must be defeated, and that the BJP, which is a Hindutva-fascist force, must not be allowed to expand in Telangana. For this reason, widespread campaigns were conducted across the state on the policies of both parties. The impact of these campaigns was also felt among the people, contributing positively to the Congress victory.

The Abhaya Hastham manifesto, prepared by the Congress party after discussing with various public groups, and the promises given in it, also reached the people effectively. Particularly, the release of the Guarantees Card by Rahul Gandhi filled people with confidence.
After the Congress government was formed, people expected that the implementation of the Six Guarantees and the promises made in the manifesto would be the government’s top priority. Civil society too repeatedly emphasised the same and continued to demand it from the government.

But although the state government under Revanth Reddy initially made some positive attempts to implement the Six Guarantees, within a very short time it began to give them lower priority. Instead, it placed its own agenda at the forefront and began to move rapidly in that direction.

Though the government claims that promises cannot be implemented because of the debts left by the previous government, the reality is that the tax revenues coming into the state, the new loans being taken by this government, and the extravagant spending on unnecessary events (such as beauty pageants and global summits) expose the government’s lack of sincerity in implementing the promises made to the people.

Moreover, although the state government has taken a few good steps in the name of social justice over the last two years, it has made no serious effort to ensure that the benefits of those steps actually reach the communities concerned.
Against the BJP, which acts against social justice, and against the policies of the Modi government at the Centre, the state government has shown no preparedness or effort to wage a political struggle. For the development model desired by the Chief Minister and a few ministers, Revanth Reddy has become increasingly dependent on the Modi government, compromising and abandoning all remaining issues related to people’s welfare and social justice.

For the past ten years, Modi’s economic policies at the Centre have benefited corporate companies, pushed the country into a debt trap, and plundered people’s rights and resources. These are statements that the top leadership of the Congress party—especially Rahul Gandhi—repeatedly asserts, even naming Ambani and Adani in his criticisms. The Congress party has made the same criticisms regarding the “Viksit Bharat” development model formulated by the Centre.

But strangely, the Revanth Reddy government, paying no attention to the Congress leadership’s criticisms, prepared the “Telangana Rising 2047” model within the framework of the Viksit Bharat model. This model has been designed for the interests of corporate companies, contractors, private firms, and big businessmen across the country, under the names of ring roads, express highways, green corridors, infrastructure development, industrial zone expansion, and construction of new cities. Moreover, as part of this model, the Revanth government is even prepared to forget Telangana’s identity and honour by naming roads after corporate companies.

On one hand, the government’s connection with ordinary people, civil society, and people’s organisations is steadily breaking. On the other hand, contractors who looted resources during the previous regime are once again drawing close to the Congress government and obtaining large contracts, gaining financial benefit.

Among the people and within civil society, dissatisfaction with the government’s functioning is growing. The communities—especially minority communities—who were instrumental in bringing this government to power have now been filled with deep disappointment and despair. In agriculture, education, youth employment, environmental protection, land acquisition, and an industrialisation model that does not provide jobs to local people—the government’s performance has been extremely disappointing. The articles in this report, written by many civil society activists on these respective sectors, clearly reflect these concerns.

A development model that concentrates half of the state’s population around Hyderabad is highly anti-development. The government’s thinking and conduct—where natural resources like land, water, and minerals are appropriated not for the real needs of the state’s people but handed over to private big businessmen and corporates—is extremely dangerous.

The Musi riverfront restoration, the construction of Future City, the refusal to cancel the Yacharam Pharma City and instead expanding pharma companies to more locations, the expansion of ethanol companies across the state—all are examples of the government’s misguided orientation.

The people of the state did not seek this kind of governance from the Congress government. This is not people’s governance in any sense. If this governance continues in the same manner, the state will be further damaged. It will only lead to strengthening anti-people parties like BRS and BJP once again in Telangana.

Thanks to the civil society representatives and leaders of people’s organisations who have written these review articles on two years of Congress rule, on the functioning of the government, and on the implementation of Congress party promises in various sectors. 

We hope that this special review will contribute towards increasing citizen awareness in Telangana.
