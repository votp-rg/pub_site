# Implementation of Manifesto Promises in the Agriculture Sector 
## <font color="teal"> Kiran Vissa, Rythu Swarajya Vedika </font> 


## Many Promises – Only a Few Implemented 

In the Abhaya Hastham Manifesto, there are many promises for agriculture. Under the “2. Agriculture – Farmer Welfare’’ chapter, the Congress party made 17 promises. Under the “8. Land Administration (Revenue)” chapter it made 7 promises. Even more importantly, three promises in the **Six Guarantees**, and three major promises from the **Warangal Declaration** (loan waiver up to ₹2 lakh, a robust crop insurance scheme, formation of a Farmers’ Commission along with a new agricultural policy). In total, the government is responsible for implementing 40 promises.

Compared to other sectors, it is true that more money has been spent on agriculture. However, the government focused its attention only on a limited number of promises. These include Six Guarantees and Loan Waiver, but there are gaps even in their implementation. Several other promises were not implemented at all; some are even being violated by the government. In the first year, people may understand prioritising only certain key promises. But even after two full years, non-implementation of many promises must be viewed as the failure of the government.


**The Four Major Promises**

Under “Rythu Bharosa” (input subsidy scheme for farmers) within Six Guarantees:
- ₹15,000 per acre for farmers and tenant farmers
- ₹12,000 for agricultural labourers
- ₹500 bonus per quintal for paddy

From the Warangal Declaration:
- ₹2 lakh farm loan waiver

> ### 1. ₹15,000 per Acre for Farmers and Tenant Farmers

The government proudly declared that, through the Rythu Bharosa Scheme in a single crop season (Kharif 2025), ₹9,000 crore was deposited into the accounts of 70.11 lakh farmers. Thus, in its second year, the government fully implemented this promise. However, instead of ₹15,000 per acre per year, the government decided to give ₹12,000. Since spending too much on a single scheme can strain the budget, this decision is understandable — but the implementation still has major flaws.

 - **Problems Carried Over from Rythu Bandhu**
Congress strongly criticised the shortcomings of the earlier Rythu Bandhu scheme and promised to fix them — such as:
    - giving benefits even for non-cultivated lands,
    - no acreage limit, which meant very large landowners received lakhs as subsidy,
    - giving benefits to landowners while tenant farmers who actually cultivate the land were excluded.

After forming the government, it set up a committee of senior ministers, held public consultations district-wise, and promised new guidelines. Because of this process, Rythu Bharosa was not implemented in the first year.
But after collecting public opinion, the government ignored it completely and implemented the same old guidelines — without even setting an acreage limit. The very issues they criticised during elections were continued exactly as they were.

- **Tenant Farmers Completely Ignored**
The Six Guarantees clearly state that tenant farmers would be included.
Revanth Reddy, during elections, wrote an open letter promising identification cards for tenant farmers under the 2011 Act and eligibility for all schemes. Rahul Gandhi himself, during the Bharat Jodo Yatra, made a special promise to tenant farmers.

Despite all this, the government has not taken even a single step to identify tenant farmers. Public consultations also strongly supported including tenant farmers — but this was completely ignored. This remains the biggest injustice done to farmers by the Congress government.

-  **In Rabi 2025, Only Farmers with up to 4 Acres Received Benefits**
Though a government order promised that the scheme would start from Rabi 2025, the benefit was given only to farmers holding up to 4 acres. As of 10 February, 34.69 lakh farmers received ₹2,218.49 crore. Lakhs of farmers waiting for Rythu Bharosa did not receive anything. If the government had taken a principled decision — such as limiting benefits to small and medium farmers based on an acreage cap — people would welcome it. But without the courage to set such a policy, and at the same time excluding lakhs of farmers with more than 4 acres, a deep dissatisfaction has been created among farmers.

> ### 2. ₹12,000 for Agricultural Labourers
Implementing this promise through the Indiramma Aatmiya Bharosa Scheme is commendable. It is injustice to give money only to landowners and ignore the landless. This scheme is an important corrective step.
However, the government must focus on the following:

- **Eligibility Rules Need Review**

The government announced that families with at least 20 days of work under NREGS in 2023-24 would be recognised as agricultural labour households. But this rule has problems:
    - Why 20 days? Why not 15?
    - Many genuinely eligible labourers could not work due to Aadhaar-linked glitches.
    - Updating the list every year is essential instead of using only a single year’s data.

- **Numbers Do Not Match**

The government said 5.79 lakh landless agricultural labour families received ₹695 crore.
But NREGS records show 13.05 lakh families worked more than 15 days.
Transparency is needed on:
    - how many have some land and are receiving Rythu Bharosa,
    - how many should receive Indiramma Aatmiya Bharosa.

- **Farmers with Less than One Acre Should Get ₹12,000**

A poor farmer with half an acre gets only ₹6,000 under Rythu Bharosa, while a landless family gets ₹12,000.

This disparity must be corrected — either by changing Rythu Bharosa guidelines or including them in Aatmiya Bharosa.

> ### 3. ₹500 Bonus per Quintal for Paddy
The scheme started in Kharif 2024 — but only for **fine-variety rice (sanna vadlu).**

In Kharif 2024, the government procured 24.1 lakh metric tonnes from 4.41 lakh farmers and paid ₹1,206.44 crore in bonuses. But in the next season (Rabi 2025), though record procurement occurred (74.22 lakh tonnes of grain; 23.19 lakh tonnes fine rice), no bonus was given.
The government cited budget constraints. Farmers were deeply distressed — if they had sold in the open market, they would have received better prices. In Kharif 2025, bonus distribution resumed. But farmers’ trust on the government has shaken.

**Who Receives the Bonus?**

In Kharif 2024, Government initiated a process for crediting this money into actual cultivator’s accounts. But instead of identifying them legally through an ID card, special registrations were done with AEOs to include tenant farmers. Some tenant farmers succeeded in receiving payments in their own accounts, others got it through landowners. But reports indicate that in Kharif 2025, officials are showing little interest in registering tenant farmers. If the government genuinely wants the bonus to reach cultivators, it must conduct a large-scale registration drive immediately.

> ### 4. ₹2 Lakh Loan Waiver
This was the biggest financial and political promise. The government implemented it ahead of other promises and completed the loan waiver of ₹20,616.89 crore for 25.36 lakh farmers in the first year itself.

Unlike the previous government, which implemented the waiver in multiple phases and caused severe problems, doing it in a single phase avoided such issues. This became one of the largest single-phase loan waivers in the country.

But problems remain:
- Farmers with loans above ₹2 lakh received nothing. They are frustrated because this limit was not clearly stated during elections.
- According to Rythu Bharosa, there are 70.11 lakh holdings. Among these, many families with multiple pattadar passbooks (husband and wife) saw their landholdings clubbed for the ₹2 lakh limit — resulting in exclusion.
- Due to technical errors, thousands of eligible farmers were left out.
For example, in Adilabad, mistakes made by a single bank resulted in thousands missing out.
- The government refused to reopen grievances just months after implementation — causing injustice to many left-out farmers.

While it understandable to put a limit on waiver, to exclude everyone above 2 lakhs without giving relief, left out many debt ridden households in the lurch.

## Other Promises
### Partially Implemented
> ### 5. Input Subsidy During Natural Calamities
After years of neglect under the previous government, this promise was crucial.
The Congress government gave input subsidy of ₹10,000 per acre in some cases.
But the implementation is incomplete. Kharif 2024 input subsidies were given. For Rabi 2025 crop loss, subsidies have not yet been given. Enumeration of losses was done in three phases in 2025, but no payments have been made.

> ### 6. Farmers’ Commission
The manifesto promised a Commission with legal powers for permanent solutions.
But the government formed one through a simple G.O. without legal powers, and with members mostly affiliated with the party, not independent experts. No formal reports, minutes, or government action based on recommendations are visible. Expert subcommittees mentioned in the G.O. were not formed. Thus, though a Commission exists, its impact is negligible. 

> ###    7. Replacing Dharani with Bhu Bharati, to bring justice to all farmers who lost ownership

The new portal was launched, some problems are being resolved, and public meetings have helped awareness. Yet many issues remain unresolved.
Without a comprehensive land survey, full resolution is impossible.

## Promises the Government Violated
1. **Fully implement the Land Acquisition Act, 2013 brought by the UPA government.** But for projects like the Regional Ring Road, the Future City, or the Musi Project — the projects this government is taking up — the Congress government is implementing the 2016 Land Acquisition Act introduced by the BRS government. In doing so, it is completely violating its own promise that it would implement the 2013 Act brought under the UPA government.

2. **Review and pay compensation for assigned and podu lands acquired by the present government, giving compensation equal to patta lands.** Instead of implementing this promise, the same process of forcibly taking assigned lands is continuing under this government as well. In fact, in the Chevella SC/ST Declaration, Congress gave an even stronger promise: “All SC/ST assigned lands grabbed by the BRS government will be restored to the original assignees with full rights.” The government is completely violating both these promises.
3. **Cancel Pharma Cities as per public opinion and as per the High Court order.**
Even though they initially announced that Pharma City was cancelled, they violated that promise and did not return the lands to farmers. Cases were filed against those fighting for these lands, and the government is diverting these lands again under the name of Future City and other projects. Now, with the slogan “Pharma means Telangana,” the government is once again attempting to promote large-scale establishment of pharma companies.
4. **Ensure full land rights to the beneficiaries over the nearly 25 lakh acres distributed to the poor during land reforms by the previous Congress government.**
Instead of granting full land rights over the assigned lands distributed earlier to the poor, we are now witnessing that in many places these assigned lands are being taken away from the respective farmers.

## Promises Not Implemented
### From the Warangal Farmers’ Declaration
- **A robust crop insurance scheme that provides immediate compensation when crops are damaged.**
Among the unimplemented promises, the most important for farmers is the crop insurance scheme. Although news repeatedly came from the government that this would be implemented each season, even after two full years, not implementing crop insurance is complete injustice. In the past two years, several times crops were damaged due to natural calamities. If a strong crop insurance system had been in place, farmers would have had at least some relief. The absence of such a scheme remains one of the major reasons for continuing farmer suicides.
- **A new agricultural policy and crop-planning system suited to Telangana’s climate, with profitable agriculture as the goal.**
Not only has an agricultural policy not been prepared till now, there has not even been a discussion on it, resulting in the Agriculture Department running without direction for two years.
- **Extension of farmer insurance to agricultural labourers and landless farmers as well.**
Since the Indiramma Aatmiya Bharosa Scheme is already under implementation, farmer insurance must immediately be applied to all the beneficiaries of that scheme.

### Agriculture – Farmer Welfare
Congress included several more promises in its manifesto after consulting with farmers’ associations. Many of these promises do not require very large budgets, but they would greatly benefit the agriculture sector. The government has focused on high-budget promises (loan waiver, Farmer Bharosa, paddy bonus) and neglected these.
- We will provide interest-free crop loans up to ₹3 lakh
- We will revive the special agricultural budget introduced by the previous Congress government
- We will provide financial support to farmers affected by submergence caused by the Kaleshwaram project, and construct embankments in Godavari and Krishna flood-prone areas
- We will revive the “Adarsha Rythu” system and establish a market yard in every mandal
- We will set up farm mechanisation centres at the mandal level
- We will restore agricultural subsidies neglected by the present government (seed subsidy, subsidies for tractors and farm machinery, fertiliser subsidy, pesticide subsidy, etc.)
- We will restore the past glory of maize cultivation
- We will abolish the practice of cutting weight citing moisture percentage in paddy procurement
- We will fill all vacant posts in agriculture and allied sectors
- To promote disappearing “traditional crops” (millets, pulses, oilseeds), we will strengthen the MARKFED marketing system along with MSP
- We will take special measures to develop vegetable production and dairy industries in the outskirts of Hyderabad and other major cities
- We will prioritise MGNREGS works for agriculture development activities
- We will give a ₹5 per litre incentive to milk producers
- To address monkey menace, we will establish a sterilisation (birth-control) centre in every district

### Land Administration (Revenue)
Replacing the Dharani portal with a new portal called Bhu Bharati will not completely solve land-records issues. Since the following promises related to real solutions have not been implemented, no steps have been taken towards comprehensive resolution:
- We will conduct a complete land survey and issue a “Bhudhaar Card’’ to every farmer
- We will implement the recommendations of the Koneru Ranga Rao Land Committee
- We will remove patta lands wrongly included in the prohibited list within 100 days of coming to power
- We will establish a “Land Commission’’ and a “Revenue Tribunal’’ to protect government lands and safeguard citizens’ land rights

## Conclusion
Although the government spent a large budget on a few major agricultural promises in the last two years, overall its performance in the agriculture sector has been very unsatisfactory. Many promises have not been implemented, and some major promises have been violated. Identifying tenant farmers and providing schemes to them, implementing a robust crop insurance system, enforcing the 2013 Land Acquisition Act, granting full rights over assigned lands to poor farmers, establishing a legally empowered Farmers’ Commission, preparing a comprehensive agricultural policy and crop policy, extending farmer insurance to agricultural labourers and landless farmers, and conducting a comprehensive land survey — these important promises remain unfulfilled.
These policy-level changes do not require large budgets. Only if the government now gives immediate priority to these issues will the agriculture sector improve.

# Unimplemented Promises, Unabating Farmer Suicides
## <font color="teal"> B. Kondal, Rythu Swarajya Vedika </font> 

While in the opposition, the Congress party repeatedly raised the issue of farmer suicides in Telangana. In the Warangal Declaration, they made grand promises, saying: “If we come to power, we will not allow farmer suicides. We will identify tenant farmers and provide them Rythu Bharosa. We will announce bonuses for all major crops. We will provide ex-gratia and a special pension to families affected by farmer suicides.” In the Six Guarantees — which they claim to be their most prestigious — they even promised Rythu Bharosa to tenant farmers. They also made it clear that every farmer suicide case would be mandatorily visited by a three-member committee. Rahul Gandhi, during the Bharat Jodo Yatra, reassured farmer families and reiterated the same words.

However, after the government was formed, the situation changed completely. In December 2023 alone, 16 farmers died by suicide. That trend continued: **249 farmers in 2024, and already 279 farmers in 2025**. Due to crop losses caused solely by heavy rains, 20 farmers ended their lives. But even in such a grave situation, not a single farmer family was visited by officials or political leaders. The three-member committee — which should have visited each affected family to understand the reasons for suicide, assess their conditions, and provide immediate support — did not visit even one family.

What is even more tragic is this: in recent incidents, some tenant farmers, expressing their agony on social media and writing with deep pain that the government was not helping them, took selfies before taking their own lives. The fact that even such families were not visited by the government further shattered the farmers’ trust in the administration.

Even more distressing is that ever since Farmer Insurance began in August 2018 during the previous government, and even after the new government came into power, the government has almost ignored the issue of farmer suicides.

In a case filed by Rythu Swarajya Vedika in the High Court, the court ordered the government in 2023 to pay compensation for the pending farmer suicide cases. The government did not implement it. As a result, a contempt of court case was filed against the government in 2024. With no other option left, in January 2025 the government sanctioned ex-gratia to 141 farmer suicide families. But the problem did not end there. Although all documents of another 200 families were correct, they too did not receive ex-gratia, forcing Rythu Swarajya Vedika to file another public interest litigation in court.

From the Chief Minister to the Agriculture Minister, from other ministers to the Agriculture and Farmer Welfare Commission — not one review meeting has been conducted on farmer suicides. Not a single letter has been sent to agricultural officials or district collectors.

At the local level, despite affected farmer families repeatedly meeting officials and local political leaders, there has been no response from any of them. In a democracy, institutions must stand with farmers. But when the situation becomes so dire, farmers are forced to turn to the judiciary as their final refuge.

The promises made by the Congress while in opposition — identifying tenant farmers, ensuring every farmer suicide case is investigated by a three-member committee, providing immediate support to farmer families — all remain mere words bundled away.


**A farmer suicide is not a statistic;**
**It is the story of a family drowned in darkness.**

They do not ask for great promises —
Only a small act of support at their doorstep.

If even that does not come,
If no investigation is done,
If the government refuses to take responsibility,

How many more families must shed tears?
How many more farmers must end their lives?

The demand of farmer suicide families, and the demand of Rythu Swarajya Vedika on their behalf, is only this:

A three-member committee must conduct an inquiry into every farmer suicide that occurred since the formation of Telangana.

Every family identified as a farmer suicide case must immediately receive ex-gratia. Tenant farmers — who are ending their lives in the highest numbers — must be supported. To address crop-loss, the primary cause of suicides, Farmer Insurance must be implemented immediately.

As suicides among agricultural labourers are also rising in the state, the G.O. must be amended to ensure compensation is provided to their families as well.

Farmer Insurance must be extended to landless tenant farmers and agricultural labourers, as promised.

This is not an additional promise…
This is the minimum responsibility a state owes to its food-growers.
